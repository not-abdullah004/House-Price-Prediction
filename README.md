Predict house prices using property features such as size, bedrooms, and location. 
🏠 House Price Prediction using Regression Models

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices using property features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.
We apply regression techniques to understand real estate pricing patterns and evaluate model performance using standard metrics.

🎯 Objectives

Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering

Train regression models (Linear Regression & Gradient Boosting)

Apply feature scaling and selection

Evaluate models using MAE and RMSE

Visualize actual vs predicted house prices

Result Visualization

📊 Model Evaluation Metrics

MAE (Mean Absolute Error) – Average absolute prediction error

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) – Penalizes larger errors more strongly

Lower values indicate better performance.
